# CadenceBeat

**CadenceBeat** is an interval metronome app, designed for runners who want to build up a new running cadence.
Listening to a steady metronome helps run at the same cadence as the metronome BPMs. The goal of the app is to 
use it for any training (Threshold, Interval, Repetition) as you can set the warm up time, where no metronome
sound is played and then schedule cycles of run/rest where the metronome will only play while running. Finally, 
there is also a cooldown period with no sound also.
